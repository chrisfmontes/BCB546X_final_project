Paper Introduction

Transposable elements (TEs) have been shown to make up a large portion of many eukaryotic genomes, especially that of *Zea Mays*.  Commonly known for their deleterious effects on host DNA, it has been shown that TEs also can contribute to regulatory variation in gene expression via complex interactions with host DNA. Previous work in *Nicotiana tabacum, Arabidopsis thaliana, *and *Oryzae sativa* has shown that abiotic stresses (heat, cold, ultraviolet light, and salt) activate the TEs and genes they insert near.  The rationale of their research was to fill the gap in knowledge as to what genes and nearby TEs are being activated in response to abiotic stress and what the proposed mechanism(s) of this process might be.
